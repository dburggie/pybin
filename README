This is a python module for easy conversion to and from binary formats. There
are several functions contained in the module as outlined below.

itoc -- takes integer in range 0 to 255, outputs a single unsigned character
        of the same value.
ctoi -- the inverse function of itoc: takes unsigned char input, outputs an
        integer in range 0 to 255.
itos -- takes integer in range 0 to 255, outputs a string containing the 
        hexadecimal representation of the integer.
stoi -- takes a length 2 string in hexadecimal form, returns an integer in
        the range 0 to 255.
unpack -- reads a file of given name. Creates a text file containing a
        a hexdump of the file with corresponding ascii representations
pack -- the inverse function of unpack. This function turns a text file
        of pairs of ascii characters in hexadecimal form and outputs a binary
        file with corresponding bytes. All characters to the right of a ';'
        are ignored.
